# Reinforcement-taxi-v3
Q-learning, SARSA, Value-iteration for Taxi-v3 problem of python Gym library.

## Taxi-v3
The taxi-v3 problem is a classic reinforcement learning problem in the Python library Gym.
The goal is to learn an agent how to navigate a grid-world environment as a taxi driver, picking up passengers and dropping them off at their desired locations.
The environment is represented by a 5Ã—5 grid, with walls blocking certain paths and 
passengers and destinations represented by colored squares. 500 states.
The agent receives a reward for successfully picking up and dropping off passengers. However, the agent also incurs a penalty for each time step is taken and for illegal actions, such as attempting to pick up a passenger who is already in the taxi.
Actions: move south, move north, move east, move west, pick up a passenger, drop off a passenger.

## Project files:
- <code>'agents.py'</code> contains algorithm classes:
	- Qlearning 
	- Sarsa
	- Value-iteration 

- <code>'main.py'</code> contains:
	- running the train and tests methods for each algorithm

- <code>'requirements.txt'</code> contains:
	- Libraries Installation

## Overview

For each algorithm, you can run a training method.
<code>agent1 = QlearningAgent()</br>agent1.train()</code>
</br>After that, policy file will be generated and saved to main path.
</br>Similarly, you can run test method <code>agent1.test()</code>

If you want to change hyperparameters such as: learning rate, discount factor, epochs, 
use: </br><code>QlearningAgent(0.9, 0.6, 2000)</code>
